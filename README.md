# pyspark_learn
- Use this repository to quickly go through some problems before any interview
- Pyspark using Google Colab notebooks
- After burning many hours trying to install pyspark on windows, I finally gave up and started using community edition of Databricks and Google Colab
- I figured out eventually how to install the pyspark but Google Colab is way too good with all the GenAI capabilities, hence continuing with this.
