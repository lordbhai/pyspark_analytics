# pyspark_learn
- Learning pyspark using Databricks community edition
- After burning many hours trying to install pyspark on windows, I finally gave up and started using community edition of Databricks
- Databricks is managed spark where you dont need to do  the redundant code and focus on solving the problem at hand.
